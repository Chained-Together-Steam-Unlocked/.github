Diverse Worlds to Explore: Each world introduces new challenges.

Solo or Multiplayer Mode: Whether you’re going it alone or teaming up with friends locally, the game adapts to fit the number of players, supporting local multiplayer for up to 4 players.

Realistic Chain Physics: The chain is not just a visual element. It is governed by a physics simulation that allows it to wrap around platforms.

3 Game Modes: The game features several difficulty modes: Beginner, Normal, and Lava mode.

Auto Save: In Beginner and Normal modes, there is a regular autosave that will allow you to resume your game where you left off if you wish to play the game multiple times (provided you are in the same mode and with the same number of players).

Leaderboards: Track your escape speeds with leaderboards that compare completion times across different player configurations.

Whether solo or in cooperation with up to 4 players in multiplayer mode, each step brings you closer to the summit!
